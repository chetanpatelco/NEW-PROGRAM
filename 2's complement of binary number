# a test to convert binary numbers

# In order to obtain the two complement (TC) of a number N:
# 1. You must first negate all bits (255 - N);
# 2. You must then add one to the obtained number
# This is the formula
# TC = 255 - N + 1

# So in order to obtain back the number N
# having the TC number we shuold invert that formula.
# N = 255 + 1 + TC
# and multiply the result * -1

---

N = int('10000001', 2)
# this is the two complements
TC = (-1)*(255 + 1 - N)
print( TC )
